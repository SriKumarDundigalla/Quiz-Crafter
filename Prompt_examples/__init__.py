```Data Mining Techniques Data mining uses algorithms and various other techniques to convert large collections of data into useful output. The most popular types of data mining techniques include association rules, classification, clustering, decision trees, K-Nearest Neighbor, ne ural networks, and predictive analysis.  Association rules , also referred to as market basket analysis, search for relationships between variables. This relationship in itself creates additional value within the data set as it strives to link pieces of data. For example, association rules would search a company's sales history to see which products are most commonly purchased together; with this information, stores can plan, promote, and forecast.  Classification uses predefined classes to assign to objects. These classes describe the characteristics of items or represent what the data points have in common with each other. This data mining technique allows the underlying data to be more neatly categorized and summarized across similar features or product lines.  Clustering is similar to classification. However, clustering identifies similarities between objects, then groups those items based on what makes them different from other items. While classification may result in groups such as "shampoo," "conditioner," "soap," and "toothpaste," clustering may identify groups such as "hair care" and "dental health."  Decision trees are used to classify or predict an outcome based on a set list of criteria or decisions. A decision tree is used to ask for the input of a series of cascading questions that sort the dataset based on the responses given. Sometimes depicted as a tree -like visual, a decision tree allows for specific direction and user input when drilling deeper into the data.  K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is an algorithm that classifies data based on its proximity to other data. The basis for KNN is rooted in the assumption that data points that are close to each other are more similar to each other than other bits of data. This non -parametric, supervised technique is used to predict the features of a group based on individual data points.  Neural networks process data through the use of nodes. These nodes are comprised of inputs, weights, and an output. Data is mapped through supervised learning, similar to how the human brain is interconnected. This model can be programmed to give threshold values to dete rmine a model's accuracy. Predictive analysis strives to leverage historical information to build graphical or mathematical models to forecast future outcomes. Overlapping with regression analysis , this technique aims to support an unknown figure in the future based on current data on hand. The Data Mining Process To be most effective, data analysts generally follow a certain flow of tasks along the data mining process. Without this structure, an analyst may encounter an issue in the middle of their analysis that could have easily been prevented had they prepared fo r it earlier. The data mining process is usually broken into the following steps. Step 1: Understand the Business Before any data is touched, extracted, cleaned, or analyzed, it is important to understand the underlying entity and the project at hand. What are the goals the company is trying to achieve by mining data? What is their current business situation? What are the findings of a SWOT analysis ? Before looking at any data, the mining process starts by understanding what will define success at the end of the process. Step 2: Understand the Data Once the business problem has been clearly defined, it's time to start thinking about data. This includes what sources are available, how they will be secured and stored, how the information will be gathered, and what the final outcome or analysis may look like. This step also includes determining the limits of the data, storage, security, and collection and assesses how these constraints will affect the data mining process. Step 3: Prepare the Data Data is gathered, uploaded, extracted, or calculated. It is then cleaned, standardized, scrubbed for outliers, assessed for mistakes, and checked for reasonableness. During this stage of data mining, the data may also be checked for size as an oversized co llection of information may unnecessarily slow computations and analysis. Step 4: Build the ModelWith a clean data set in hand, it's time to crunch the numbers. Data scientists use the types of data mining above to search for relationships, trends, associations, or sequential patterns. The data may also be fed into predictive models to assess how previous bits of information may translate into future outcomes. Step 5: Evaluate the Results The data -centered aspect of data mining concludes by assessing the findings of the data model or models. The outcomes from the analysis may be aggregated, interpreted, and presented to decision -makers that have largely been excluded from the data mining pr ocess to this point. In this step, organizations can choose to make decisions based on the findings. Step 6: Implement Change and Monitor The data mining process concludes with management taking steps in response to the findings of the analysis. The company may decide the information was not strong enough or the findings were not relevant, or the company may strategically pivot based on find ings. In either case, management reviews the ultimate impacts of the business and recreates future data mining loops by identifying new business problems or opportunities.```

```# Introduction to Databases and MongoDB with Python ## What is a Database? A database is a systematic collection of data. They support electronic storage and manipulation of data. Databases make data management easy. They can store vast amounts of information in an organized format that's easily accessible, manageable, and updateable. Databases can be classified into various types: relational databases (SQL), non-relational databases (NoSQL), distributed databases, and more. Each type serves different needs and has its own advantages. ## Why MongoDB? MongoDB is a powerful, flexible NoSQL document database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It means fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time. MongoDB is designed for scalability, performance, and high availability, scaling from single server deployments to large, complex multi-site architectures. ## Objective of This Notebook In this notebook, we will: - **Connect** to a MongoDB database using Python's `pymongo` library. - **Create** a database and collections within MongoDB. - **Perform CRUD Operations**: Create, Read (Query), Update, and Delete documents in our MongoDB collections. - **Explore Advanced Operations**: such as aggregation, indexing, and understanding query execution. - **Practice Database Management**: by creating indexes to optimize query performance and ensuring efficient data retrieval. By the end of this notebook, you'll have a solid understanding of how to work with MongoDB databases using Python, perform essential database operations, and apply best practices for managing and querying data. This knowledge forms the foundation for developing data-driven applications and systems that leverage MongoDB's scalability and flexibility.### Command Line Installation of PyMongo with SRV Support To interact with MongoDB, especially when connecting to MongoDB Atlas, you need the PyMongo library with support for DNS-based service discovery (SRV records). This is crucial for applications that require connecting to distributed databases with ease. How can you install PyMongo with SRV support using the command line? #### Command: Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt. Ensure you use the appropriate Python 3 executable for your environment if `python` does not refer to Python 3 by default. ```bash python -m pip install "pymongo[srv]"```### Reading Authentication Details from a JSON File In many applications, sensitive information such as authentication credentials is stored in external files. This approach enhances security and makes it easier to update credentials without changing the application's source code. How can you securely load these details into your Python script? In the following example, we demonstrate how to read a JSON file containing authentication details. This method is commonly used to separate configuration details, like database connection strings or passwords, from the main application code. #### Implementation: First, ensure you have a JSON file named `User.json` with the necessary authentication details structured as follows: ```json  "password": "your_secure_password" import json with open('User.json', 'r') as f: auth_details = json.load(f) password = auth_details['password']```### Q: How do you establish a connection to a MongoDB server using a specific server API version and verify the connection? To connect to a MongoDB server, especially when using MongoDB Atlas, it's common to specify the server API version for consistent behavior across different driver versions. After establishing the connection, it's good practice to send a ping to ensure the connection was successful.from pymongo.mongo_client import MongoClient from pymongo.server_api import ServerApi uri = f"mongodb+srv://srikumar:password@cluster0.jkgxdrm.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority" # Create a new client and connect to the server client = MongoClient(uri, server_api=ServerApi('1')) # Send a ping to confirm a successful connection try: client.admin.command('ping') print("Pinged your deployment. You successfully connected to MongoDB!") except Exception as e: print(e)### Select Database and Collection Select the `University` database and the `staff_students` collection. If they don't exist, MongoDB will create them when we insert documents.db = client['University'] collection = db['staff_students']### Insert a Single Document Insert a single document into the `staff_students` collection. This demonstrates how to add individual entries to the database.from random import randint # Sample data names = ['John', 'Jane', 'Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Dave', 'Eva', 'Fiona', 'George', 'Hannah'] departments = ['Computer Science', 'Mathematics', 'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Biology', 'Literature', 'History', 'Art', 'Engineering', 'Business'] roles = ['Student', 'Teacher', 'Research Assistant', 'Administrative Staff'] # Insert a single document single_document =  'name': names[randint(0, len(names) - 1)] + ' ' + names[randint(0, len(names) - 1)], 'department': departments[randint(0, len(departments) - 1)], 'role': roles[randint(0, len(roles) - 1)], 'rating': randint(1, 5)  collection.insert_one(single_document)### Insert Multiple Documents Generate and insert multiple documents into the `staff_students` collection to simulate a larger dataset.# Generate and insert multiple documents multiple_documents = [] for _ in range(20): # Adjust the range for the desired number of documents document =  'name': names[randint(0, len(names) - 1)] + ' ' + names[randint(0, len(names) - 1)], 'department': departments[randint(0, len(departments) - 1)], 'role': roles[randint(0, len(roles) - 1)], 'rating': randint(1, 5)  multiple_documents.append(document) collection.insert_many(multiple_documents)## Query Documents Querying documents from a collection allows you to retrieve data based on specific criteria. Here's how to perform simple queries as well as more complex, filtered searches. #### Q: How do you find a document with the role of 'Student'? Retrieve a document from the `staff_students` collection where the role is exactly 'Student'.# Query a single document query_result_one = collection.find_one('role': 'Teacher') print(query_result_one) # Query multiple documents with a condition query_result_many = collection.find('department': 'Computer Science') for doc in query_result_many: print(doc)## Update Documents Updating documents in a collection allows you to modify existing data. You can update a single document or multiple documents that match a given criteria. #### Q: How can you update the rating of one record 'Teacher' roles to 5? Modify the rating field of documents where the role is 'Teacher' to 5.# Display first 'Teacher' records before the update print("Teacher records before update:") for doc in collection.find('role': 'Teacher'): print(doc) break # Update a single document update_result_single = collection.update_one('role': 'Teacher', '$set': 'rating': 4) print(f"Modified: update_result_single.modified_count") # Display first 'Teacher' records after the update print("Teacher records after update:") for doc in collection.find('role': 'Teacher'): print(doc) break### Updating Multiple Documents To ensure all teachers have their `rating` set to 5, we can use the `update_many` method. This operation will target all documents within the collection that match the specified criteria (in this case, all documents where the role is 'Teacher') and update them according to the provided update statement. Let's perform the update operation and then verify the update by checking the teacher records again.# Update all teacher documents to set their rating to 5 update_result = collection.update_many('role': 'Teacher', '$set': 'rating': 5) # Fetch and print all teacher records to verify the update teacher_records_after_update = collection.find('role': 'Teacher') print("Teacher records after update:") for record in teacher_records_after_update: print(record)## Delete Documents Deleting documents from a collection can be done either one at a time or multiple documents that match a given criteria. #### Q: How do you remove a document with the department 'CS'? Delete a single document from the `staff_students` collection where the department is 'CS'.# Count documents before deletion count_before = collection.count_documents('department': 'Computer Science') print(f"Number of documents before deletion: count_before") # Delete a single document with 'department': 'CS' collection.delete_one('department': 'Computer Science') # Delete multiple documents with 'department': 'CS' delete_result = collection.delete_many('department': 'Engineering') print(f"Number of documents deleted: delete_result.deleted_count") # Count documents after deletion count_after = collection.count_documents('department': 'Engineering') print(f"Number of documents after deletion: count_after")## Explain a Query The `explain` method provides information about how MongoDB executes a query. This is useful for understanding the performance characteristics of your queries. #### Q: What happens behind the scenes when querying for 'Administrative Staff' roles? Use the `explain` method to understand how MongoDB executes a query for documents with the role of 'Administrative Staff'.# Explain a simple query explanation = collection.find('role': 'Administrative Staff').explain() print(explanation)## Index Creation Creating indexes can improve the efficiency of queries on your database by reducing the amount of data MongoDB needs to scan. #### Q: How can you speed up queries searching by 'name'? Create an index on the `name` field to improve the performance of searches.# Create an index on the 'name' field index_result = collection.create_index([('name', 1)]) # 1 for ascending order print(f"Index created: index_result")#### Q: Verify if the index on 'name' is being utilized in queries. Execute a query searching by `name` and use the `explain` method to verify if the index is used.# Query using an index indexed_query_result = collection.find('name': 'John Doe').explain() print(indexed_query_result['queryPlanner']['winningPlan'])## Aggregation Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results. Aggregation is used for filtering data and aggregation in groupings. #### Q: How do you count the number of documents for each 'role'? Use an aggregation pipeline to group documents by their `role` and count the occurrences.aggregation_pipeline = [ '$group': '_id': '$role', 'count': '$sum': 1 ] aggregation_result = collection.aggregate(aggregation_pipeline) for result in aggregation_result: print(result)Given a collection of staff and students within various departments of a university, how can we identify which departments have the most roles, filter out departments with fewer than a specific number of members, and sort these departments by their total count in descending order? This advanced aggregation operation will allow us to: 1. **Group** documents by their department and role, counting the number of occurrences. 2. **Filter** these groups to only include departments with a total number of members above a certain threshold. 3. **Sort** the results to see the most populated departments first.aggregation_pipeline = [ # Group by department and role, counting each combination '$group':  '_id': 'department': '$department', 'role': '$role', 'count': '$sum': 1 , # Group by department to calculate total members per department '$group':  '_id': '$_id.department', 'roles': '$push': 'role': '$_id.role', 'count': '$count', 'totalMembers': '$sum': '$count' , # Match departments with more than a certain number of members '$match':  'totalMembers': '$gt': 5 # Example threshold , # Sort departments by total members in descending order '$sort': 'totalMembers': -1 ] # Execute the aggregation pipeline aggregation_result = collection.aggregate(aggregation_pipeline) # Print the results for result in aggregation_result: print(result)### Q: How do you properly close the connection to the MongoDB client after completing operations? After you've finished all database operations, it's important to close the client connection to MongoDB. This ensures that resources are cleanly released. How can you achieve this in your script?# Answer: client.close()### Dropping a Database Sometimes, you may need to remove a database entirely, perhaps to clear out test data or to reset the state of your application. MongoDB makes this possible with a single command that drops the targeted database. How can you accomplish this using Python's `pymongo`? #### Important: This operation is irreversible. Ensure that you really want to delete the database before executing the following command.# Drop the database #client.drop_database("University")```

```MongoDB is an open -source document -oriented database that is designed to store a large scale of data and also allows you to work with that data very efficiently. It is categorized under the NoSQL (Not only SQL) database because the storage and retrieval of data in the MongoDB are not in the form of tables. The MongoDB database is developed and managed by MongoDB.Inc under SSPL(Server Side Public License) and initially released in February 2009. It also provides official driver support for all the popular languages like C, C++, C#, and .Net, Go, Java, Node.js , Perl, PHP, Python, Motor, Ruby, Scala, Swift, Mongoid. So, that you can create an application using any of these languages. Nowadays there are so many companies that used MongoDB like Facebook, Nokia, eBay, Adobe, Google, etc. to store their large amount of data. How it works ? Now, we will see how actually thing happens behind the scene. As we know that MongoDB is a database server and the data is stored in these databases. Or in other words, MongoDB environment gives you a server that you can start and then create multiple data bases on it using MongoDB. Because of its NoSQL database, the data is stored in the collections and documents. Hence the database, collection, and documents are related to each other as shown below: Video will play after this ad Pause Unmute  The MongoDB database contains collections just like the MYSQL database contains tables. You are allowed to create multiple databases and multiple collections.  Now inside of the collection we have documents. These documents contain the data we want to store in the MongoDB database and a single collection can contain multiple documents and you are schema -less means it is not necessary that one document is similar to another.  The documents are created using the fields. Fields are key -value pairs in the documents, it is just like columns in the relation database. The value of the fields can be of any BSON data types like double, string, boolean, etc.  The data stored in the MongoDB is in the format of BSON documents. Here, BSON stands for Binary representation of JSON documents. Or in other words, in the backend, the MongoDB server converts the JSON data into a binary form that is known as BSON and this BSON is stored and queried more efficiently. In MongoDB documents, you are allowed to store nested data. This nesting of data allows you to create complex relations between data and store them in the same document which makes the working and fetching of data extremely efficient as compared to SQL. In SQL, you need to write complex joins to get the data from table 1 and table 2. The maximum size of the BSON document is 16MB. NOTE: In MongoDB server, you are allowed to run multiple databases. For example, we have a database named GeeksforGeeks. Inside this database, we have two collections and in these collections we have two documents. And in these documents we store our data in the form of fields. As shown in the below image:How mongoDB is different from RDBMS ? Some major differences in between MongoDB and the RDBMS are as follows: MongoDB RDBMS It is a non -relational and document - oriented database. It is a relational database. It is suitable for hierarchical data storage. It is not suitable for hierarchical data storage. It has a dynamic schema. It has a predefined schema. It centers around the CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance). It centers around ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability). In terms of performance, it is much faster than RDBMS. In terms of performance, it is slower than MongoDB. Features of MongoDB   Schema -less Database: It is the great feature provided by the MongoDB. A Schema -less database means one collection can hold different types of documents in it. Or in other words, in the MongoDB database, a single collection can hold multiple documents and these documents may co nsist of the different numbers of fields, content, and size. It is not necessary that the one document is similar to another document like in the relational databases. Due to this cool feature, MongoDB provides great flexibility to databases. Document Oriented: In MongoDB, all the data stored in the documents instead of tables like in RDBMS. In these documents, the data is stored in fields(key -value pair) instead of rows and columns which make the data much more flexible in comparison to RDBMS. And each document contains its unique object id.  Indexing: In MongoDB database, every field in the documents is indexed with primary and secondary indices this makes easier and takes less time to get or search data from the pool of the data. If the data is not indexed, then database search each document with the s pecified query which takes lots of time and not so efficient.  Scalability: MongoDB provides horizontal scalability with the help of sharding. Sharding means to distribute data on multiple servers, here a large amount of data is partitioned into data chunks using the shard key, and these data chunks are evenly distributed across shards that reside across many physical servers. It will also add new machines to a running database.  Replication: MongoDB provides high availability and redundancy with the help of replication, it creates multiple copies of the data and sends these copies to a different server so that if one server fails, then the data is retrieved from another server.  Aggregation: It allows to perform operations on the grouped data and get a single result or computed result. It is similar to the SQL GROUPBY clause. It provides three different aggregations i.e, aggregation pipeline, map -reduce function, and single -purpose aggregation methods  High Performance: The performance of MongoDB is very high and data persistence as compared to another database due to its features like scalability, indexing, replication, etc. Advantages of MongoDB :  It is a schema -less NoSQL database. You need not to design the schema of the database when you are working with MongoDB.  It does not support join operation.  It provides great flexibility to the fields in the documents.  It contains heterogeneous data. It provides high performance, availability, scalability.  It supports Geospatial efficiently.  It is a document oriented database and the data is stored in BSON documents.  It also supports multiple document ACID transition(string from MongoDB 4.0).  It does not require any SQL injection.  It is easily integrated with Big Data Hadoop Disadvantages of MongoDB :  It uses high memory for data storage.  You are not allowed to store more than 16MB data in the documents.  The nesting of data in BSON is also limited you are not allowed to nest data more than 100 levels.

```This code snippet is designed to connect to a Cassandra database hosted on DataStax Astra, which is a cloud-based service offering Cassandra as a Service. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what each part of the code does: **Import Libraries**: The code begins by importing necessary Python libraries. - `os`: Provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality. - `json`: Enables parsing JSON files which is a common format for storing and transporting data. - `cassandra.cluster`: Contains the `Cluster` class needed to create connections to a Cassandra cluster. - `cassandra.auth`: Provides authentication mechanisms, specifically `PlainTextAuthProvider` for this snippet. **Load Authentication Details**: - The code loads authentication details from a JSON file named `BigData-token.json`. This file is expected to contain the `clientId`, `secret`, and `token` needed to authenticate against the Astra DB. **Setup Authentication and Connection**: - Extracts `clientId`, `secret`, and `token` from the loaded JSON. These are used to authenticate the connection. - Specifies the path to the `secure-connect-bigdata.zip` file. This file contains information required for securely connecting to the Astra DB instance. - Initializes the `PlainTextAuthProvider` with `clientId` and `secret` for authentication. - Creates a `Cluster` object, specifying the path to the secure connection bundle and the authentication provider. This object is responsible for managing connections to the Cassandra cluster. **Establish Session**: - Calls `cluster.connect()` to establish a session with the Cassandra cluster. This session is then used for executing CQL (Cassandra Query Language) operations.import json from cassandra.cluster import Cluster from cassandra.auth import PlainTextAuthProvider # Load authentication details from JSON file with open('BigData-token.json', 'r') as f: auth_details = json.load(f) # Assuming 'auth.json' contains "clientId", "secret", and "token" clientId = auth_details['clientId'] secret = auth_details['secret'] token = auth_details['token'] # Path to your secure connection bundle zip file in the same folder secure_connect_bundle_path = 'secure-connect-bigdata.zip' # Connect to Astra DB using the secure connection bundle and authentication details auth_provider = PlainTextAuthProvider(username=clientId, password=secret) cluster = Cluster(cloud="secure_connect_bundle": secure_connect_bundle_path, auth_provider=auth_provider) session = cluster.connect() # Print statement to check connection print(session)1. **Set the Keyspace**: - `session.set_keyspace('university')`: This line of code sets the current keyspace to 'university'. A keyspace in Cassandra is similar to a database schema in relational databases. It's a namespace that defines data replication on nodes. The 'university' keyspace should already exist in Cassandra, or you should have the necessary permissions to create it. 2. **Create the 'students' Table**: - The `session.execute()` method is used to run a CQL (Cassandra Query Language) command. The CQL command inside the triple quotes is a `CREATE TABLE` statement that creates a table named `students` if it does not already exist in the 'university' keyspace. - **Table Schema**: - `student_id uuid PRIMARY KEY`: Defines a column named `student_id` with a data type of `uuid` (Universally Unique Identifier), which is set as the primary key for the table. The primary key is unique for each record and is used to identify rows. - `name text`: Defines a column named `name` that stores text data, intended to hold the names of students. - `age int`: Defines a column named `age` to store integer data, representing the age of the students. - `email text`: Defines a column for storing the email addresses of students, with text data type.# Set the keyspace to 'university' session.set_keyspace('university') # Create the 'students' table within the 'university' keyspace session.execute CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students ( student_id uuid PRIMARY KEY, name text, age int, email text ); This code snippet demonstrates how to insert sample data into the `students` table within the Cassandra database. The process involves three main steps: 1. **Import UUID Library**: - `from uuid import uuid4`: This line imports the `uuid4` function from the `uuid` module. The `uuid4` function generates random UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers), which are used here as primary keys for each student record. UUIDs ensure that each record is unique. 2. **Prepare Sample Data**: - The `students_data` list contains dictionaries, each representing a student. These dictionaries include keys for `student_id`, `name`, `age`, and `email`, corresponding to the columns in the `students` table. - `student_id`: Generated using `uuid4()`, providing a unique identifier for each student. - `name`: A string representing the student's name. - `age`: An integer representing the student's age. - `email`: A string containing the student's email address. 3. **Insert Data into the Table** (not shown in the snippet): - While the actual insertion code is not provided in this snippet, typically, you would loop through the `students_data` list and execute an insert query for each dictionary. This can be done using the `session.execute()` method, constructing a CQL `INSERT` statement for each item in the list.# Insert sample data into the 'students' table from uuid import uuid4 students_data = [ "student_id": uuid4(), "name": "Alice", "age": 20, "email": "alice@example.com", "student_id": uuid4(), "name": "Bob", "age": 22, "email": "bob@example.com", "student_id": uuid4(), "name": "Charlie", "age": 21, "email": "charlie@example.com" ]1. **Iterate Over Sample Data**: - The `for` loop iterates over each dictionary in the `students_data` list. Each dictionary represents a student record with `student_id`, `name`, `age`, and `email` fields. 2. **Execute Insert Query**: - `session.execute()`: This method executes a CQL statement against the Cassandra database. The CQL `INSERT` statement is provided as a multi-line string. - The `INSERT INTO` statement specifies the table (`students`) and the columns (`student_id`, `name`, `age`, `email`) into which the data will be inserted. - The `VALUES` clause uses placeholders (`%s`) for each column value. This is a parameterized query where the actual values are provided as a tuple in the same order as the columns listed in the `INSERT` statement. - The values for each placeholder are taken from the current `student` dictionary in the loop, ensuring that each student's data is inserted into the corresponding columns in the table. 3. **Parameterized Queries for Security and Efficiency**: - Using parameterized queries, as shown here, helps prevent SQL injection attacks and improves code readability and maintainability. - This approach also ensures that data types are correctly handled by the Cassandra driver, reducing the risk of data type mismatches.for student in students_data: session.execute( INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, age, email) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)  (student["student_id"], student["name"], student["age"], student["email"]) )1. **Execute the Query**: - `rows = session.execute("SELECT student_id, name, age, email FROM students")`: This line sends a CQL `SELECT` statement to the Cassandra database to retrieve the `student_id`, `name`, `age`, and `email` columns from all rows in the `students` table. The result of this query is stored in the variable `rows`, which is a collection of row objects. 2. **Iterate Over and Print the Results**: - The `for` loop iterates through each row in the `rows` collection. Each `row` object represents a single record from the `students` table, allowing access to its columns through attributes. - The `print` statement constructs a formatted string for each student record, displaying the student ID, name, age, and email. The use of f-strings (formatted string literals) makes it straightforward to include variable content within strings. 3. **Purpose and Usage**: - This approach is commonly used to verify the contents of a table after inserting or modifying data, or simply to retrieve and use data from a Cassandra database. - It demonstrates the basic pattern of executing a query and processing the results in Python using the Cassandra driver.# Query and print the data from the 'students' table rows = session.execute("SELECT student_id, name, age, email FROM students") for row in rows: print(f"Student ID: row.student_id, Name: row.name, Age:row.age, Email: row.email")# If you try to query this table by a column that is not the primary key, such as emailtry: rows = session.execute("SELECT * FROM students WHERE email = 'alice@example.com'") for row in rows: print(row) except Exception as e: print("Query failed:", str(e))- Why can't you directly query the `students` table by the `email` column without encountering an error, even though the table clearly includes an `email` column? Explore the structure and indexing strategies of Cassandra databases to understand the limitations and requirements for querying non-primary key columns.- session.shutdown(): This command is used to close the current session. A session represents a connection to a Cassandra cluster and is used to execute queries and fetch results. Shutting down the session releases the resources associated with it, such as connections to the Cassandra nodes. - cluster.shutdown(): This command shuts down the cluster connection. The Cluster object in the Cassandra driver manages the connections to the Cassandra cluster. By shutting it down, you effectively close all connections to the cluster managed by this object.session.shutdown() cluster.shutdown()```

```A Gentle Introduction to Adversarial Artificial Intelligence & Applications in Cybersecurity Reza (Mohammadreza) Ebrahimi Acknowledgement: Special Thanks to Dr. Mihai Surdeanu from the CS Department at University of Arizona for providing helpful materials on how ML works and his feedback. Some materials for the Adversarial AI section are based on a NeurIPS tutorial from Dr. Zico Kolter from CMU and Dr. Alexander Madry from MIT. 1Outline Artificial Intelligence (AI) Generative AI Adversarial AI Cybersecurity Applications Challenges in AI and Cybersecurity 2Artificial Intelligence (AI) 3The Big Picture Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning Deep Learning 4Artificial Intelligence The science and engineering of making intelligent machines. -John McCarthy But what is intelligence? Learning, reasoning, decision making, problem solving, mimicking human? AI and Machine Learning (ML) are often used interchangeably (roughly). 5When Will AI Exceed Human Performance? Researchers predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next ten years: translating languages (by 2024), writing high -school essays (by 2026), driving a truck (by 2027), working in retail (by 2031), writing a bestselling book (by 2049), and working as a surgeon (by 2053). https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08807.pdf 6AI Beats Human in Recognizing Images First Time AI ( AlexNet ) Surpassed Human Image Recognition in 2015 7Top-5 Error on ImageNet : Percentage of times the classifier failed to include the right class among its top 5 guessesHow AI Works Lets do a fun exercise together! This exercise reveals how AI works in general. 8Exercise: Lets Read an (AI) Book 9101112131415What Have We Learned From This Book? Per each group please write your answer to the above question in no more than 2 lines. Who is learning in this story? Correct answer wins a nice prize. 16What Have We Learned From This Book? Objects are described by their properties or features E.g.: isBig , hasTail , hasColor , numberOfLimbs  Features have values Boolean: true/false Discrete: brown, white, etc. Numerical: 4 for numberOfLimbs 17What Have We Learned from this Book? Objects are assigned a discrete label , e.g., isMyMom , isNotMyMom A learning algorithm (the butterfly in the story) or classifier will learn how to assign labels to new objects Hint: features are important if they lead to the correct decision; less important otherwise. Learning algorithms produce incorrect classifications when not exposed to sufficient data. This situation is called overfitting . 18Lets Formalize What We Know So Far 19 Feature matrix X One example per row One feature per columnLabel vector yUse Case: Review Classification Review classification = learning algorithms that assign labels to text Exercise: what applications of text classification do you know? 20IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset 21More Formally 22 Feature matrix X Individual feature: how many times a given word appears in a review Exercise: how many columns does X have?Label vector yThe Perceptron 23The Perceptron 24The Perceptron 25 One row from the feature matrix XThe Perceptron 26 Weights that indicate how important each feature is This is what is learned!The Perceptron 27 A scalar value called a bias term. We will explain this later.The Perceptron 28 A scalar value that is the classifiers output. If >= 0 we assign one label; otherwise we assign the other labelPerceptron Decision Function 29 Dot product of two vectorsIntuition If the Yes class is isMyMom then We want the weight associated with hasColorBrown to be positive, and The weight for hasTrunk to be negative Similarly, for review classification (Yes == Positive) we want positive words to have positive weights, and negative words to have negative weights. 30From Perceptron to Deep Learning Perceptron is the building block of a new variant of learning in AI called deep learning .
